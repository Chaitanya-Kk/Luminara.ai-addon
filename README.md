## üèóÔ∏è How It's Built

### 1. Project Setup

Scaffolded the project using Adobe's official add-on template:

```bash
npx @adobe/create-ccweb-add-on design-chat-addon --entrypoint panel --template javascript
```

This command created a basic Adobe Express add-on structure with a `panel` entry point and JavaScript template. It included:

* `index.html`
* `index.js`
* `styles.css`
* `manifest.json` in the `/dist` folder

### 2. Customizations & Development

* **UI Development**: Modified `index.html` and `styles.css` to design a lightweight, sidebar-based chat interface.
* **Logic Implementation**: Rewrote default logic in `index.js` using TypeScript (`index.ts`) for better type safety and structure. Transpiled with:

```bash
npx tsc
```

* **AI Integration**: Connected Google Gemini 1.5 Flash for real-time chat by calling:

```ts
const url = 'https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash:generateContent';
```

* **Custom Features**: Handled user prompts for layout tips, copywriting, and design ideation tailored for Adobe Express projects.

### 3. Manifest & Configuration

Updated `/dist/manifest.json` to:

* Include permissions for network access (Gemini API)
* Set up Adobe Express-specific panel configuration
